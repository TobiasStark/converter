## This project is built using a very modern and efficient technology stack, featuring a Svelte frontend and a Go backend powered by the Gin framework.

### Frontend
* **Svelte:** A cutting-edge compiler that converts your declarative components into highly efficient imperative code, updating the DOM directly and minimizing overhead.

### Backend
* **Go (Golang):** A statically typed, compiled programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and excellent concurrency support.
* **Gin:** A high-performance HTTP web framework for Go, ideal for building robust and scalable APIs.
